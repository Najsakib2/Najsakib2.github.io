          <h2>Chicken</h2>
              Chickens are daft creatures with no brain at all. They have absolutely NO sense whatsoever and this story confirms it.

There was once a group of chickens, who fitted the above description well, that arrived at a busy road. No they didn't fly across or anything like that, they simply tried to cross it. As is the norm with chickens, the smallest chicken went first. This brave (or stupid) chicken attempted to cross the road by playing chicken with the cars. Turns out playing chicken when you are a chicken is a bad mistake. One nil to the busy road.

Next, the oldest chicken announced that they would make a chicken catapult. They all agreed that it was an amazing idea and quickly constructed one. After counting down from two they fired the second youngest chicken into the air. Majestically, the valiant young chicken flew through the air like a feathery firework, carrying his fellow chicken's hopes and dreams...for around 20cm before SPLAT! His adventure was ended by the number 29 double decker bus.

They came up with many more cunning schemes: a chicken chain, a disguise and a tunnel. The first resulted in SPLAT! The second resulted in quite a few SPLATS as well as a horrified driver, who had thought he had killed someone dressed in a long coat and trousers. The final idea, didn't result in SPLAT! But instead quite a few broken beaks as concreate is difficult to dig through when you're a chicken.

Now there were only 3 or 4 chickens left. They sat down on the dusty road and thought. Then the leader had an idea. The plan was simple. Climb up the nearby metal tower with long ropes that stretched into the distance. Peak though the ropes and swing across the road. Unfortunately, the three chickens that attempted the plan ended up peaking at a 10000 volt electric cable. For several days afterwards the area smelt like chicken dinner.

The only chicken left now was oldest one, who decided to just go for it. Breathing deeply, he closed his eyes and ran into the busy road. Flapping and keeping his eyes shut he ran like his life depended on it (which it did). Finally, he tripped over a block and fell face down. Slowly, opening his eyes, he was amazed to see he was on the opposite side. He had done it! He had finally crossed the road! After jumping around like a headless chicken (of which he was thankful he wasn't) he gathered his thoughts and strolled toward the one place that he and his fellow chickens had been aiming for all along. They called it chicken heaven. A place so great that pictures of chickens covered the walls, tables and signs. A true paradise and now it was just yards away. All chickens knew its name - Kome Forth Chickens or as the humans called it KFC. Sauntering in through the front doors, the chicken smiled his biggest - and last - smile.
When Denise Edwards (not her real name) saw a text on her 11-year-old son’s phone that said, “Im gonna kill you 2mrw” from an unrecognized number, her heart stopped. She asked her son about it and was shocked to hear an older boy on his bus had been sending these types of texts for about two months.
Experts estimate that teens are at least four times more likely to say something hurtful or demeaning to another child when behind the veil of a phone or computer.
Tim Woda, a digital safety expert, explains: “Cyberbullies are often not the biggest kids on the playground or the meanest girls at school. If you want to protect against cyberbullying, parents need to be aware of what their kids are doing online and be willing to act quickly when they see a red flag.”
Here are a few tips for parents to prevent cyberbullying:
* Talk about it: The best defense is a good offense. Ask your child how they would respond if someone were mean to them online. What should they do? Is it okay to forward a text message making fun of someone?
* Spot it: Cyberbullying can cause kids to avoid using their phone or computer, or appear stressed when receiving an e-mail or text. They may act reluctant to attend social or school events or avoid conversations about school or friends. In extreme cases, the child will have declining grades, stop eating or have difficulty sleeping.
* Deal with it: Teach them to never respond, save the evidence and report the incident to an adult they trust. Next, engage school administrators to discuss their cyberbullying policy and develop a plan of action. Finally, talk about the situation with the bully and the parents. Sometimes a school guidance counselor can act as a mediator for this type of meeting.
* Prevent it: Stealing your child’s phone or their passwords to social networking accounts is not an ideal way to understand what’s going on in their digital world. Use a parental intelligence service, such as uKnowKids.com, that can alert you to dangerous behavior and cyberbullying. The best time to install parental monitoring software is the moment a child gets a social media account or mobile phone so kids accept it for the long run.
